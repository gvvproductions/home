He has also been raised for life in the district of Amsterdam, together with his (only) Jewish family where he feels safe. as a small toddler, he was diagnosed with autism. but he had a great talent, "signs", he watched a lot of Mickey Mouse, and he draws that a lot. In 2007, Guy went to a Disney drawing course in Rotterdam. and there he meets one of the Disney artists "Ruben Procopio". Guy was quick to draw Mickey Mouse and Simba in drawing, and quickly showed him to Ruben. One of his most favorite show was also present in the Netherlands. That was the show Monster Jam that was for the third time in Arnhem, and the Saturday night show, was his very first show. He also often draws, and also became a big Monster Jam fan. In 2009, he also started to love football. Actually, he would be his whole life for Ajax, but that was not his only club. Vitesse from Arnhem temporarily became his club until the end of the summer of the year 2011. And so, he became a fan of the club of his hometown "Ajax". In those times he even wanted to become a professional footballer later, and set up a club himself. Unfortunately, it had not become him. First in summer 2009, he went on football for the first time, and ended up in the E-pupils (O12). in the end, in 2010, he was trying to find another team. In 2011, Guy forced himself to go on football. First the afternoon after the Vitesse Kids Club Day in 2011, he drove with his father from Arnhem back to Amstelveen for an interview at the first a red-yellow football club "Sporting Martinus". the plan to go to football there had not gone through. because at Sporting Martinus that they play too wild, the reason seems to be. and then followed the second attempt at another club in Amstelveen. the club that sits next to the swimming pool "De Meerkamp", but also nowadays next to the new Amstelveen College which was only completed in 2013. The blue-white club "NFC". Guy went there to try, with his neighbor "Noah van der Baan" to follow the training of the D1. The boys were fanatical, but they were nice to Guy. And a while later unfortunately, went to G-football because of the decision of his parents. At the end of his year as a footballer in 2015, Guy stops playing football because of his injuries. Guy has played for clubs like Roda'23, Noordwijk / FC Lisse and Only Friends. Guy was always drawing during and after his year. During his injury to his inguinal hernia where he was operated on, he signed a family with motorsport event "The Johnsons". His plans emerged for his first series of characters under the name "Tony Motors".<br>that is based on the series like Family Guy, The Simpsons, South Park, Brickleberry and American Dad. and Tony Motors gets inspirations for subjects like Motorsport (FMX, sports car race, and Monster Trucks). First Guy wanted to work with other animators. But that plan was unfortunately not successful, because they were all not interested in it.<br>In the end it was his plan to do it himself. He went to download Animation programs on his computer, and he watched tutorials. and that was him himself succeeded. He did online collaborations with other voice actors as an unpaid project. And he formed a non-profit film company. One that was the creation of the GVV Productions. and in early 2018, his first episode appeared on YouTube.<br></p>

From February 2018 the first season of the first series "Tony Motors" was shown on YouTube, with a total of 6 episodes. Tony Motors is animated and roughly drawn in a funny way, to attract a large audience. the humor of Tony Motors is rough and fetish. In these 3 early years, Guy and his GVV Productions experienced a hard time. Since May 2017 Guy went to live in the Papageno House in Laren, and also has a benefit. The GVV Productions began to receive support from the family and friends of Guy. But the big drawbacks of the 3 years were that a small number of supervisors from Papageno Huis and S'Heeren Loo interfere with Guy's GVV Productions. But also that he was obliged to follow daytime activities. Even in late 2018, Guy bought his expensive film camera stuff, and the first film will be directed. The film "Stalked" was unfortunately canceled because the cast was successful, but it was arranged without an appointment, while there will be compensation, while unfortunately it is not possible to arrange it and come into collaboration. From November 2018 to 2019, he tried 3 days a week to attend work training at DVS'33 in Ermelo. And so in late March 2019 a conversation came with his work trainer and personal counselor. at that time, the GVV Productions is working more on its film projects in evenings. because for that Guy continued to fight for much more time for his non-profit film company with its productions.<br></p>
